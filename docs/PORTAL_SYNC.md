# Portal Sync (Portal Publisher)

Portal Sync keeps a portal in step with what has been published to it in **Portal Publisher**.
It is the portal side of _Portal Sync Protocol v1_.

- **Pull, not push.** The `portal-sync` service asks the publisher for a manifest of what should
  be live, fetches snapshots of new or changed recordings, runs them through the NLP processor
  into Weaviate, and removes recordings that were unpublished. The publisher never gets
  credentials to your server, and the portal never needs a TheirStory token.
- **"Sync now" pings.** Portal Publisher can also POST a signed, data-free ping to
  `https://<your-domain>/api/portal-sync` after each publish or unpublish, so changes show up
  within a minute instead of at the next poll.

```

```

## What a sync run does

1. `GET {PORTAL_PUBLISHER_URL}/api/portal/v1/manifest` with `Authorization: Bearer $PORTAL_SYNC_TOKEN`.
2. Compares the manifest with the local state file, `json/.portal-sync/state.json`
   (`storyId → version, collectionId, Testimony UUID, file`).
3. **Removals first.** For each synced story that is no longer in the manifest, it deletes the
   story's `Chunks` (`theirstory_id == uuid`) and its `Testimonies` object from Weaviate,
   deletes its JSON file, and forgets it.
4. **Removals requested by the publisher.** For each entry in the manifest's optional `removals`
   (unmanaged Testimonies, see [Existing data](#existing-data)), it deletes that Testimony's
   Chunks and object, and every JSON file under `json/interviews/**` whose story `_id` is that
   story id (so a later `weaviate:import` doesn't bring it back). A removal whose uuid is managed
   (in the state file, or the uuid of an item in the same manifest) is ignored, and so are the
   synced files. A Testimony that is already gone counts as removed.
5. **Updates, one at a time** (NLP is heavy). For each story that is new, has a new `version`,
   moved to a different collection, or whose collection name or description changed:
   - `GET /api/portal/v1/items/{storyId}`
   - if the collection changed, deletes the old Testimony UUID and its file first
   - writes the payload to `json/interviews/<collectionId>/<storyId>.json`, or to
     `json/interviews/<collectionId>/<folder path>/<storyId>.json` when the item has a folder, so a
     later `weaviate:import` derives the same folder, plus
     `json/interviews/<collectionId>/collection.json` (`id`, `name`, `description`; any other
     keys you add, such as `image`, are kept)
   - `POST /process-story?write_to_weaviate=true&run_ner=true` to the NLP processor, which
     replaces that Testimony's chunks in place
   - runs `PORTAL_SYNC_POST_PROCESS_COMMAND`, if set
   - records the new version only if all of that succeeded. Failed items are retried on the next run.
6. **Data version.** If anything was synced or removed, it bumps
   `json/.portal-sync/data-version.json` (`{ "version": <int>, "updatedAt": "…" }`, written
   atomically). The frontend reads it with `getDataVersion()` (`lib/data-version.ts`, re-checked at
   most every 2 seconds, `"0"` when the file is missing) to drop in-memory caches and build ETags.
7. `POST /api/portal/v1/status` at the start (`running`) and at the end (`succeeded`, `partial` or
   `failed`), with a result for every item the run touched. Publisher-requested removals are
   reported as `{ "storyId", "uuid", "state" }`.
8. **Inventory.** It lists every Testimony in Weaviate (uuid, story id, `collection_id`,
   `interview_title`, and whether it is managed) and `POST`s it to `/api/portal/v1/inventory` when
   it differs from the last accepted report, or at least every 24 hours. The Testimonies schema has
   no story-id property, so for unmanaged Testimonies the story id is read once from the
   `transcription` JSON and cached in `json/.portal-sync/inventory.json` (with the last sent hash
   and time). An inventory failure is only logged; the next run retries it.

Portal-sync removes stories it synced itself when they are unpublished. Interviews you imported by
hand (`yarn weaviate:import`) are only touched when someone in Portal Publisher either publishes the
same story into the same collection id (portal-sync takes it over, "adopting" it) or asks for that
Testimony to be removed from the portal's inventory (see [Existing data](#existing-data)).

The Testimony UUID is the same one `weaviate:import` and the NLP processor use:
`uuidV5("<collectionId lowercased>:<storyId>", URL namespace)` (`scripts/lib/testimony-ids.ts`).

## Configuration

Set these in `.env.production` (production compose) or `.env.local` (dev compose):

| Variable                                   | Default                                 | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORTAL_PUBLISHER_URL`                     | (none)                                  | Base URL of Portal Publisher, e.g. `https://publisher.theirstory.io`. **Required.**                                                                                       |
| `PORTAL_SYNC_TOKEN`                        | (none)                                  | The `pps_…` token shown once when the portal was created in Portal Publisher. **Required.** Keep it secret. It is never logged.                                           |
| `PORTAL_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES`             | `15`                                    | How often to poll. `0` turns polling off, so syncs happen only at startup and on pings.                                                                                   |

| `PORTAL_SYNC_POST_PROCESS_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` | `60`                                    | Kill the post-process command after this long (`0` = no limit).                                                                                                           |
| `PORTAL_SYNC_NLP_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`          | `30`                                    | Timeout for one `/process-story` call.                                                                                                                                    |
| `PORTAL_SYNC_PORT`                         | `7171`                                  | Port of the service's internal HTTP server. It is not published to the host.                                                                                              |
| `PORTAL_SYNC_HOST`                         | `portal-sync`                           | Used by the **frontend** to reach the service (`http://$PORTAL_SYNC_HOST:$PORTAL_SYNC_PORT/trigger`). Set it to `localhost` when you run both outside Docker.             |
| `PORTAL_VERSION`                           | package version                         | Reported as `portalVersion` in status reports. A git SHA works well here.                                                                                                 |
| `PORTAL_SYNC_STATE_FILE`                   | `./json/.portal-sync/state.json`        | Where sync state lives.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `INTERVIEWS_DIR`                           | `./json/interviews`                     | Same meaning as for `weaviate:import`.                                                                                                                                    |
| `PORTAL_SYNC_DATA_VERSION_FILE`            | `./json/.portal-sync/data-version.json` | Data version file, written by the service and read by the frontend (set it the same on both if you change it).                                                            |

Weaviate and NLP connection settings are the same ones the importer uses: `WEAVIATE_HOST_URL`,
`WEAVIATE_PORT`, `WEAVIATE_SECURE`, `WEAVIATE_ADMIN_KEY` (optional), and `NLP_HOST`, `NLP_PORT`,
`NLP_SECURE` (default `nlp-processor:7070`).

If `PORTAL_PUBLISHER_URL` or `PORTAL_SYNC_TOKEN` is missing, the service logs
`Portal sync is disabled` and idles. It does not crash-loop. `/api/portal-sync` then returns `503`.

## Enable it on a droplet

1. In Portal Publisher, create the portal (or rotate its token) and copy the `pps_…` token.
2. On the droplet, in the repo, add to `.env.production`:

   ```bash
   PORTAL_PUBLISHER_URL=https://publisher.theirstory.io
   PORTAL_SYNC_TOKEN=pps_...
   # optional
   PORTAL_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15
   ```

3. Start (or recreate) the service, and the frontend so it picks up the new route and env:

   ```bash
   git pull
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build portal-sync frontend
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f portal-sync
   ```

   `./scripts/deploy/deploy-prod.sh` also starts `portal-sync`, because it brings up every
   service in `docker-compose.prod.yml`.

4. In Portal Publisher, set the portal's **sync URL** to:

   ```
   https://<your-domain>/api/portal-sync
   ```

   The frontend route checks nothing itself. It forwards the raw body (8 KB max) and the
   `X-Portal-*` headers to the internal `portal-sync` service. That service verifies the
   HMAC-SHA256 signature (constant-time compare, timestamp within 5 minutes of now) and answers
   `202`. Pings that arrive during a run are merged into a single follow-up run.

You should see `Sync … started (startup)` and then `Sync … succeeded: N synced, …` in the logs.

### Frontend data version

The production compose file mounts `./json/.portal-sync` read-only into `frontend` at
`/app/json/.portal-sync` (the dev compose file mounts the whole repo), so server code can call
`getDataVersion()` from `lib/data-version.ts`. The service creates the directory on startup.
Recreate the frontend once after pulling this change:
`docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d frontend`.

### Health / status

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec portal-sync \
  node -e "fetch('http://127.0.0.1:7171/health').then(r=>r.json()).then(console.log)"
cat json/.portal-sync/state.json          # lastSync + every synced item
cat json/.portal-sync/data-version.json   # bumped after each run that changed Weaviate
cat json/.portal-sync/inventory.json      # last inventory hash / time sent
```

## Manual runs and testing

A one-shot run (manual runs or cron) exits `0` on success and `1` on a failed or partial run:

```bash
# Inside Docker, using the service's env and volumes:
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm portal-sync yarn portal-sync:once

# Locally, against a dev stack (Weaviate on :8081, NLP on :7070):
PORTAL_PUBLISHER_URL=https://publisher.theirstory.io PORTAL_SYNC_TOKEN=pps_... \
WEAVIATE_HOST_URL=localhost WEAVIATE_PORT=8081 NLP_HOST=localhost \
  yarn portal-sync:once
```

A run lock (`json/.portal-sync/state.json.lock`) stops a manual `--once` from colliding with
the running service. If the service is mid-run, the manual run logs that and exits `0`.

To check that the ping path works end to end, sign a ping yourself:

```bash
TOKEN=pps_...; BODY='{"portalId":"test","reason":"manual","requestedAt":"now"}'; TS=$(date +%s)
SIG=$(printf '%s' "$TS.$BODY" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$TOKEN" | awk '{print $NF}')
curl -i -X POST https://<your-domain>/api/portal-sync \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H "X-Portal-Timestamp: $TS" -H "X-Portal-Signature: sha256=$SIG" \
  -d "$BODY"      # expect HTTP 202
```

Unit tests (HMAC verification, manifest diffing, coalescing, the trigger server, inventory
hashing and sending, publisher-requested removals, the data version, and full runs against
in-memory fakes) need no running services:

```bash
yarn portal-sync:test
```

## Existing data

Portals that were filled with `theirstory:import-stories` + `weaviate:import` before sync was set up:

- **The publisher sees them.** Every Testimony is in the inventory the portal reports after each
  run, marked `managed: false`. From Portal Publisher you can adopt one (publish that recording;
  with the same collection id it is replaced in place) or remove it. Removals arrive in the next
  manifest and are applied as described in [What a sync run does](#what-a-sync-run-does), step 4.

- **Same collection id.** If the publisher's `collectionId` matches the collection id the old
  import used (the `id` in that folder's `collection.json`, or the folder name), the Testimony
  UUID is the same. The first sync **replaces the Weaviate data in place**. No duplicates appear.
- **The old JSON file stays on disk.** The old importer named files `ts-portal-<title>-<format>.json`,
  often under `json/interviews/imported/`. Portal Sync writes `<collectionId>/<storyId>.json`
  and leaves the old file where it is. A later `yarn weaviate:import` (or `weaviate-init`) would
  import that file again. With the same collection id that re-import only overwrites the synced
  version with the older snapshot. With a **different** collection id (e.g. the default
  `imported`), the old copy is a separate Testimony and the story appears **twice**.

Clean up with the bundled helper, which finds JSON files whose story is now synced but that
are not the synced file:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm portal-sync yarn portal-sync:legacy          # dry run
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm portal-sync yarn portal-sync:legacy --apply  # delete
```

`--apply` deletes those files. When a copy used a different collection id, it also deletes that
copy's Testimony and Chunks from Weaviate. Run it after the first successful sync.

Other notes:

- Don't edit files under `json/interviews/<collectionId>/` by hand for synced stories. The next
  change from the publisher overwrites them, and an unpublish deletes them.
- Deleting `json/.portal-sync/state.json` makes portal-sync treat everything as new. It then
  re-processes every item, which is safe but slow, and it can no longer remove stories that are
  missing from the manifest, because it doesn't know it ever had them.
- The state file is keyed by story id and doesn't care which portal a token belongs to. If you point
  a portal at a different Portal Publisher portal, every story from the old one is removed.

## Post-process hook (forks with extra enrichment)

Forks that run extra enrichment after the NLP step can hook it in. For example, the Stanford fork
runs Claude entity extraction:

```bash
PORTAL_SYNC_POST_PROCESS_COMMAND='yarn tsx scripts/extract-entities-claude.ts --uuid "$STORY_UUID"'
```

The command runs with the service's working directory (`/app`) and environment, plus
`STORY_ID`, `STORY_UUID` (the Testimony UUID), `COLLECTION_ID` and `STORY_FILE` (absolute path to
the JSON). `PORTAL_SYNC_TOKEN` is removed from its environment. Its output is logged with the
story id. A non-zero exit (or timeout) marks that item `failed`, so it is retried on the next
run: the NLP step runs again, then the command. Make the command idempotent.

## Operations

Portal Publisher lives at https://publisher.theirstory.io (`PORTAL_PUBLISHER_URL=https://publisher.theirstory.io`).
Publish, unpublish and adopt recordings there. The portal picks the change up on the next ping or poll.

### Redeploying safely

**Don't rebuild while a sync is running.** Recreating containers mid-run can kill `/process-story`
after the processor deleted a recording's old chunks but before it inserted the new ones. That
Testimony is left with 0 chunks, so it is missing from entities and search. Check first:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec portal-sync \
  node -e "fetch('http://127.0.0.1:7171/health').then(r=>r.json()).then(j=>console.log(j.running, j.pending))"
```

Rebuild only when it prints `false false`. Rebuild only what changed, with `--no-deps` so
`nlp-processor` and `weaviate` are not recreated:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build --no-deps portal-sync frontend
```

`./scripts/deploy/deploy-prod.sh` runs `up -d --build` for every service, so the same check applies.

If a run is interrupted anyway, nothing needs fixing by hand. The item's version is only recorded
after it succeeded (a new or adopted item stays at version `""`), so it is retried on the next run.
A lock left by a killed run goes stale and is cleared after 2 minutes.

### Disk space and read-only Weaviate

Every `--build` leaves build cache behind (about 8–15 GB, on a 58 GB droplet). Prune it after each
deploy:

```bash
docker builder prune -a -f
df -h /
```

Above 90% disk use, Weaviate turns its shards read-only and processing fails with
`store is read-only due to: disk usage too high`. It does **not** switch back by itself once space
is freed. Free space first, then set the shards back to `READY`:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec -T portal-sync node --input-type=module -e "
const base = 'http://weaviate:8080/v1/schema';
for (const c of ['Testimonies', 'Chunks']) {
  const shards = await (await fetch(base + '/' + c + '/shards')).json();
  for (const s of shards) {
    if (s.status === 'READY') { console.log(c, s.name, 'READY'); continue; }
    const r = await fetch(base + '/' + c + '/shards/' + s.name, { method: 'PUT', headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify({ status: 'READY' }) });
    console.log(c, s.name, s.status, '->', r.status);
  }
}"
```

A `200` means that shard is writable again. Failed items are retried on the next run (or use
"Sync now").

### Long recordings

A long interview on a small droplet can take well over 5 minutes to process. The `/process-story`
call uses `node:http`, not `fetch` (whose 5-minute headers timeout used to fail every long recording
with `fetch failed`), and is bounded by `PORTAL_SYNC_NLP_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` (default `30`). Raise it
for 3h+ interviews on slow hosts, then recreate `portal-sync`.

### Caches and the data version

After a run that synced or removed something, `data-version.json` is bumped, and frontend code
that uses `getDataVersion()` drops its caches within about 2 seconds. A manual `weaviate:import` (or
any other change made outside portal-sync) does **not** bump it. In this fork the entities index
(`/api/entities`) and the captions and thumbnail ETags are keyed on it; without a bump, entities
refresh within 5 minutes and captions within an hour. To bump it by hand:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec -T portal-sync node -e "
const fs = require('fs'), f = '/app/json/.portal-sync/data-version.json';
let v = 0; try { v = Number(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(f, 'utf8')).version) || 0 } catch {}
fs.writeFileSync(f, JSON.stringify({ version: v + 1, updatedAt: new Date().toISOString() }) + '\n');
console.log('data version', v + 1);"
```

The number has to change. A plain `touch` is not enough: the frontend re-reads the file, sees the
same version and keeps its caches.

### Titles

Adopting or publishing a recording replaces the portal's copy with TheirStory's current data,
title included, so a title fixed only on the portal side is overwritten. Fix titles in TheirStory
and publish again.

## Troubleshooting

### Sync failed in Portal Publisher

Hover "Sync failed" to see the error. Usually:

- `fetch failed` or another connection error: the NLP processor (or Weaviate) restarted or is
  unreachable. See [Redeploying safely](#redeploying-safely).
- `store is read-only`: disk. See [Disk space and read-only Weaviate](#disk-space-and-read-only-weaviate).
- `NLP /process-story failed: HTTP 500 …`: check `docker logs nlp-processor-prod`.
- `timed out after …` / `no response for …`: see [Long recordings](#long-recordings).
- `post-process command exited …`: `PORTAL_SYNC_POST_PROCESS_COMMAND` failed (e.g. a missing
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). Its output is in `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs portal-sync`.

Failed items are retried on every run.

### A recording is missing from entities or search

Usually a run was interrupted after the old chunks were deleted, leaving the Testimony with 0
chunks. Count them (`<uuid>` is the Testimony UUID from `json/.portal-sync/state.json`):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec -T portal-sync node -e "
fetch('http://weaviate:8080/v1/graphql', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: '{ Aggregate { Chunks(where: {path: [\"theirstory_id\"], operator: Equal, valueText: \"<uuid>\"}) { meta { count } } } }' }) })
  .then(r => r.json()).then(j => console.log(JSON.stringify(j.data)))"
```

The interrupted item was never recorded as synced, so the next run reprocesses it (use "Sync now"
to not wait). If it is still at 0 after a successful run, check that run's error in Portal Publisher.

### An unpublished recording still shows up

On the next run after an unpublish, portal-sync deletes the Testimony, its Chunks and its JSON file,
then bumps the data version. If the recording still shows up:

- Look for `Remove failed for …` in `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs portal-sync`
  (read-only shards, for example). Failed removals are retried.
- A copy imported by hand under a different collection id is a separate, unmanaged Testimony.
  Remove it from the portal's inventory in Portal Publisher (see [Existing data](#existing-data)).
- If the frontend predates the `./json/.portal-sync` mount, recreate it:
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --no-deps frontend`.
- For changes made outside portal-sync, [bump the data version](#caches-and-the-data-version).
